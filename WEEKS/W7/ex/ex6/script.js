// Create a global variable called bankAmount which value is the amount of money currently in your account.
// Create a variable that saves the % amount of VAT (In Israel, itâ€™s 17%).
// Create an array with all your monthly expenses, both positive and negative (money made and money spent).
// Example : let details = ["+200", "-100", "+146", "+167", "-2900"]
// Create a program that modifies the expenses (ie. the positive AND the negative expenses) so that
// they will include taxes (multiply each expense by the VAT).
// Display your current bankAccount standing at the end of the month.
